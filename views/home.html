        Miles Morales first appeared in Ultimate Fallout #4 (August 2011), following the death of Peter Parker. The 13-year-old biracial teenage son of an African-American father and a Puerto Rican mother, he is the second Spider-Man to appear in Ultimate Marvel, an imprint with a separate continuity from the mainstream Marvel Universe called the Ultimate Universe (Earth-1610).[6] He was featured in the Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man comic book series, and after Marvel ended the Ultimate imprint in 2015, Miles was made a character in the main Marvel Universe (Earth-616), beginning with stories under the All-New, All-Different Marvel branding that debuted that same year, with the older native 616-Morales ultimately being established as the character's archenemy: Ultimatum. The character was not the lead character in the Ultimate Spider-Man animated television series on but he was later added to the main cast, as Kid Arachnid,[7] and featured the main protagonist in the 2018 animated feature film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse which won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, and its 2023 and 2024 sequels.
